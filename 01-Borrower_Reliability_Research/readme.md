# Ð¡onclusions
Based on the results of the study, conclusions were drawn about the dependence of the probability of loan delinquency on various characteristics of the borrower.

Based on these findings, it is possible to draw up a "portrait of an ideal borrower", in respect of which one can expect the least probability of delay. This is a **married / married borrower with no children with an income of 30,001 to 50,000 who wants to get a loan to buy real estate**.

And, on the contrary, the least reliable borrower will be an **unmarried borrower, incl. civil, with 4 children, with an income of up to 30,000, who wants to get a car loan**.
