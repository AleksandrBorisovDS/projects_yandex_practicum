# Task
Based on data from cellular operator customers, analyze customer behavior and search for the optimal tariff.

# Project description
A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs was carried out on a sample of clients, the behavior of clients when using the operatorâ€™s services was analyzed and optimal sets of services for users were recommended. 
Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. 
Hypotheses about the difference in revenue for subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in revenue for subscribers from Moscow and other regions were tested.

# Tools
- Pyton
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy

# As a result of the analysis:
The data is preprocessed: gaps are highlighted, replaced with appropriate values, data are reduced to the required types, anomalies and outliers are identified.
The required parameters were calculated and visualized.
The behavior of users of two tariffs was studied. The average count, minimums, maximums, median and range of the sample are visualized. The distribution, variance and standard deviation are described.
As a result of testing the hypotheses, it was established:
- the average revenue of tariff users varies significantly;
- the average revenue of users from Moscow does not differ from the revenue of users from other regions.
