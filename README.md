The purpose of the project: to learn how to determine the market value of real estate.
Set parameters to build an automated system capable of tracking down anomalies and fraudulent activity.

Libraries used: **pandas, matplotlib**.

Progress:

**Step 1.
Studying general information.**

**Step 2. Data preprocessing.**

Identify, study and fill in missing values.
Replacing the data type.

**Step 3.
Calculation of additional parameters.**

- calculation of the price per square meter.
- specifies the day of the week, month and year of publication of the announcement.
- categorization of the floor of the apartment.
- determining the ratio of living and total area, as well as the ratio of kitchen area to total.

**Step 4. Exploratory data analysis.**

- studying the area, prices, number of rooms, ceiling heights. Construction of histograms for each parameter.
- studying the time of sale of the apartment. Building histograms.
- cut off rare and outliers. Description of detected features/
- search and study of the factors most influencing the cost of an apartment. Studying the dependence of price on area, number of rooms, distance from the center. Studying the dependence of the price on the floor of the apartment, on the date of placement: day of the week, month and year.
- calculation of the average price per square meter in 10 settlements with the largest number of ads. Identification of settlements with the highest and lowest cost of housing.
- learning information about the distance to the center. Calculation of the average price for each kilometer. Construction of a graph of price dependence on distance from the center.
- analysis and study of the parameters of apartments located in the center. Identification of factors that affect the cost of apartments in the center.

**Step 5. General conclusion.**

**Results:**

The data is preprocessed: 
- gaps are highlighted, replaced by the corresponding values,
- the data is converted to the required types,
- anomalies and outliers are identified, the missing values ​​are filled in.

The required parameters are calculated and categorized.

Areas, prices, number of rooms, ceiling heights were studied. The average number, minima, maxima, median and range of the sample are visualized.

The distribution, variance and standard deviation are described.
The factors most affecting the cost of an apartment are identified and visualized. 

Appropriate conclusions on the project are made.
